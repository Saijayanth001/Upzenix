Titanic Dataset – Key Insights

1. Gender Impact:
Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males, indicating priority evacuation.

2. Passenger Class:
First-class passengers survived at much higher rates than second- and third-class passengers,
showing strong socio-economic influence on survival.

3. Age Factor:
Children and younger passengers had slightly better survival chances than older adults.

4. Fare Correlation:
Passengers who paid higher fares (proxy for class and cabin location) had better survival rates.

5. Overall Insight:
Survival was not random. It was strongly influenced by gender, socio-economic status, and partially by age.

Conclusion:
Emergency protocols and social norms (“women and children first”) clearly influenced survival outcomes.
